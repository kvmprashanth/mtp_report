\chapter{Requirements of new policy}
  
  The following are the list of requirements of new policy that we would like to enforce,
  
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \textbf{Prioritized memory allocation:} Currently the notion of priority doesn't exist in container specific memory allocation 
although the notion of priority exists in other resources. The existing knobs fail to enforce priority used to manage memory in containers. 
      \item \textbf{Deterministic provisioning:} The policy to be designed must eliminate existing non determinism that exists while 
managing memory between containers in existing system.
      \item \textbf{Adaptive:} On changing resources provisioned to the system as in the case of an derivative environment, the policy 
enforced must still do it's best in maintaining promised QOS.
      \item \textbf{Differentiated memory reclamation:} The policy could build around the notion of differentiated memory reclamation when 
the system falls under memory pressure.
      \item \textbf{Strict enforcement of limits:} The notion of hard and soft limits that exist must be strengthened.      
    \end{enumerate}
    
  We would like to design a new policy keeping the above requirements in mind.
