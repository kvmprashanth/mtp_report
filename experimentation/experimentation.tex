\chapter{Empirical Analysis}

  The list of questions mentioned in section:\ref{section_questions} are questions of interest that would help us understand the existing 
memory management techniques better. We have tried answer the listed questions by mapping them into appropriate experiments. Inferences 
were drawn based on the observations in the experiments. There were 3 different categories of questions we have tried to answer using 
empirical analysis as listed below,
  
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Verify the correctness of our hypotheses
    \item Try to understand parts of memory management for which hypothesis couldn't be drawn
    \item Understand the implications of existing memory management on application performance
  \end{enumerate}
  
  For the sake of simplicity, questions of category 1 and 2 were answered using the native testbed using synthetic workloads as described 
in section:\ref{section_testbed_native}. Questions of category 3 were answered using the derivative testbed using real workloads as 
described in section:\ref{section_testbed_derivative}
