  The list of questions mentioned in section:\ref{section_questions} are questions of interest that would help us understand the existing 
memory management techniques better. We have tried answer the listed questions by mapping them into appropriate experiments. Inferences 
were drawn based on the observations in the experiments. There were 3 different kinds of questions we have tried to answer using empirical 
analysis,
