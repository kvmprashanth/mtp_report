    The following are a list of the future possible directions of memory management controller, 
    
      \begin{enumerate}
	\item The policy enforcement using existing memory controller framework is using static weight setting,
	we could expand this to incorporate a dynamic weight setting based on an higher level overall application
	objective. 
	\item Explore other Linux \cg{} - analyze their behavior, bring forward their drawbacks and design solutions to
	fix their drawbacks.
