    Cloud computing has emerged as one of the hot topics in the computing community today. Most servers these days are either 
already running on cloud, or are in the virtue of shifting base to cloud. Cloud providers traditionally multiplex a set of compute 
resources, to group of isolated clients using hardware level virtualization techniques that make use of Virtual Machines (VM) to deploy 
isolated Virtual Environments (VE). 

    Although VMs provide a very effective methodology in provisioning compute over the cloud, they incur heavy overheads there by degrading 
efficiency while provisioning. Lately, there has been a new direction in the flow of research in virtualization, i.e OS-level virtualization 
in which compute resources in a system are virtualized at an OS-level to provision light weight isolated VEs called Containers. Containers 
provide similar features to that as VMs but incur much lesser overheads \cite{felter2015updated} \cite{morabito2015hypervisors} . A recent 
work \cite{sharma2015spotcheck} has also tried to take it a step ahead, by provisioning compute resources to clients using an nested 
approach in which repackages and resells resources purchased from native Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud provider. This approach is 
coined as derivative cloud.

    In this work, we have made an initial attempt to understand memory management between containers. We started off with purposing 
hypotheses based on theoretical evidences. We performed analysis to verify the correctness of our purposed hypotheses and understand parts 
of memory management for which hypotheses couldn't be drawn. We then tried to extrapolate its implications on real world applications 
running inside a derivative cloud environment running VMs on the host machine and containers in the guest machine. These implications 
strongly suggested that existing memory management techniques may impact higher provisioned containers negatively. We conclude by purposing 
the requirements of a new desired policy that provides this notion of a differentiated reclamation to enforce deterministic allocation when 
the system is under memory pressure. The end goal of our work is to provide an adaptive deterministic resource provisioning framework for 
container based services.
