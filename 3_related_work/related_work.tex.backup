    There have been several attempts to provide efficient memory management for virtual machines. The most prominent used approach is of 
that Ballooning \cite{waldspurger2002memory}. Ballooning is an mechanism that reclaims pages considered least valuable by the guest OS 
running inside the virtual machine. This allows the VM to decide which memory pages to release instead of the host trying to determine this.
Gerḿan Molt́o \cite{molto2013elastic} expands the idea of Ballooning to provide a system to monitor the VM memory and apply vertical 
elasticity rules in order to dynamically change its memory size by using the memory ballooning technique provided the KVM hypervisor. 
Overdriver \cite{williams2011overdriver} on the other hand presents a system that handles all durations of memory overload. It adapts its 
mitigation strategy to balance the trade offs between migration and cooperative swap to handle memory overcommitments. Ex-Tmem 
\cite{venkatesan2014ex} stores clean pages in a two-level buffering hierarchy with locality-aware data placement and replacement. It 
enables memory-to-memory swapping by using non-volatile memory and eliminates expensive I/O caused by swapping.
  
    Looking at researches that have looked at resource provisioning, Tim Dornemanna \cite{dornemann2009demand} solution that automatically 
schedules workflow steps to underutilized hosts and provides new hosts using cloud computing infrastructures in peak-load. The system was 
based on BPEL to support on-demand resource provisioning. CloudScale \cite{shen2011cloudscale} can resolve scaling conflicts between 
applications using migration, and integrates dynamic CPU voltage/frequency scaling to achieve energy savings with minimal effect on 
application SLOs.
