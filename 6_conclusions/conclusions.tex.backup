    We have made an initial attempt to understand the working of memory management in Linux
    containers. We identified issues with the existing memory management controller used to
    provision containers in a native and derivative cloud environment. We have empirical 
    verified our hypotheses. We then have proposed a differentiated memory management 
    controller by making modifications to the existing controller. Our controller supports
    different types of memory management policies among containers provisioned using a Linux
    containers framework. We have demonstrated the working of this controller and evaluated the 
    effectiveness of controller in overcoming the pitfalls of the existing controller. 
    Our controller has shown its ability of differentiated memory provisioning among containers 
    and how it positively impacts application performance.
  
    We made an attempt to understanding hypervisor caching frameworks and how they are used to 
    meet application level objectives.
